                <p1>
                    Diane Stefani won a motion to dismiss a lawsuit against a charter school in which a student sued for a serious knee injury.
                </p1>

                <p>
                    The case involved a case of first impression in the application of the statute of limitations of the Governmental Tort Immunity
                    Act and the court dismissed the case with prejudice. An important win for charter schools throughout
                    the city.
                </p>

                <p1>Ashley Portman achieved a pre-suit settlement for 100% of the damages sought by her client, an employee theft
                    policy insurer.</p1>
                <p>
                    The settlement was reached with the insured’s ex-employee who was accused of stealing materials from the insured and selling
                    them for personal profit.
                </p>

                <p1>Betsy Grover and Dom Savaiano recently won a not-guilty verdict after a nearly two-week trial in Cook County,
                    Illinois. </p1>
                <p>The medical malpractice case involved an allegedly misplaced and loosened prosthesis inserted by our doctor,
                    requiring a more drastic surgery within 11 months of the surgery by our client. Plaintiff is a female
                    Vietnam veteran, having served in the Army and the Marines for 8 years. She currently works for the VA
                    Hospital. Plaintiff asked the jury for at least $750,000. The jury promptly returned a verdict in favor
                    of the defendant and against the plaintiff. Among the significant moments of the trial was the cross
                    examination of Plaintiff’s expert, a well-credentialed orthopedic surgeon, who was led to describe findings
                    on an x-ray that did not actually exist and who was impeached more than a dozen times during the cross
                    examination. </p>

                <p1>Frank DeBoni & Jack Murphy successfully defended a punitive damages claim brought against a world renowned
                    5 Star Luxury Hotel in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. </p1>
                <p>Despite the Plaintiff’s allegations of willful and wanton conduct, Mr. DeBoni & Mr. Murphy were able to demonstrate
                    that the hotel had no prior notice of the alleged condition that caused Plaintiff’s injuries. After a
                    4 day trial, the jury returned a “no liability” verdict. </p>

                <p1>Michael Griffin obtained a settlement in excess of $500,000 in a Missouri fire case involving negligent maintenance
                    of a commercial ventilation system. </p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>Ashley Portman settled a property subrogation matter relating to a water loss at an insured's hotel with
                    an uninsured third-party. </p1>
